TO DO
====

The novel
---------

- Write a synopsis of the novel it's a sequel to: [Historia LÃ³gico-Natural](https://authorcentral.amazon.com/gp/books/book-detail-page?ie=UTF8&bookASIN=B00CLOF224&index=default&language=en_US)
- Revise it thoroughly. 

Stuff around the novel
----------------------

- Draw a map of the Republic of Florida.- Graph the evolution of quality with time with the tests made.
- Write a selective translator to [Ciazarn, the carny Latin](http://www.goodmagic.com/carny/ciazarn.htm). Not a high priority, anyways...

Web and presentation
--------------------

- Create a CSS that suits the content.
- Write a script to convert it to ePub just the way I like it.
- Convert automatically to POD into Text::Hoborg.
- Write a converter to a presentation with impress.js. 
- Write a clickable interface to issues, so that you can go from text to issue directly (to suggest corrections, for instance) See: http://developer.github.com/v3/#cross-origin-resource-sharing
- Write a program that selects randomly paragraphs for corrections and set a bot that sends them to Twitter from time to time.

The setup
---------

- Check the possibility of having the text annotated with commit comments and publish it automatically.  
- Create an easy installer. This is not going to be easy.
