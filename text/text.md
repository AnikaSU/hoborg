Meet the mechanical man
----------------------------------

There he was, gleaming in places, rusty in others. Jumping and
whistling and frolicking to the general merriment of the public. 
And I'm using *he* liberally here, since I'm talking about a
mechanical man. A mechanical being. A mechanical... gimmick that looks
like a man.

And the public... filled with brothers, of my own race, of the other
races that have been oppressed since they arrived here or since the
paleface newcomers arrived. Because my name is Fulgencio
GÃ³mez and  I was born and raised in California from a Guatemalan mother and
a Mexican father. That was twenty and three years ago.
