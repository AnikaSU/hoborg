Meet the mechanical man
----------------------------------

There he was, gleaming in places, rusty in others. Jumping and
whistling and frolicking to the general merriment of the public. 
And I'm using *he* liberally here, since I'm talking about a
mechanical man. A mechanical being. A mechanical... gimmick that looks
like a man.

And the public... the people there would make anybody like me nervous
even in broad daylight. Not a single white man there. Negroes,
indians, chinamen... spics like me. Because my name is Fulgencio
GÃ³mez, and although I am American in heart, and a good American at
that, I was born and raised in California from a Guatemalan mother and
a Mexican father. That was twenty five years ago.
