hoborg
======

A dieselpunk novel with Spanish-created robot hobos in a balcanized
America at the beginning of the XX century 

Plot outline
---------------

After America is defeated by a technologically superior Cuba and
Spain, Florida becomes an independent multiracial socialist state
which is inmediately at war with the (now diminished) America. 

An American Pinkerton agent is sent into that state to recover a
*mechanical man* that has been seen in a circus doing gigs from
Pensacola to St. Pitersburg entertaining the masses. 

He succeeds, but going back to Washington is not easy. He becomes a
raiway hobo, accompanied with a hobo cyborg - the hoborg of the title.

How you can help
-----------------------

After 4 paragraphs, you might have already realized English is not my
main language. Sending me corrections  is not the only way you can help

* Get a GitHub account http://github.com.
* Watch, star or fork this repo. You don't need to do anything else.
   for the time being, but it will help me achieve some visibility.
* You can interact with the text and the rest directly from the web:
  you can comment on text and changes in it (called *commits*).
* You can also request changes on the text using *issues*. If you find
  an error of any kind, just raise an issue and I'll fix it (or try
  to).
* Create your own version: once forked, you can use git (check out
  this manual http://wiki.freegeek.org/index.php/Git_for_dummies ) to
  branch and evolve the story in whicheer way you want.
* You can keep it (hey, it's free as in free speech) or, if you think
  it's a worthwhile addition to Hoborg, do a Pull Request.
* [Check out the TODO list](TODO.md). 

Full disclosure
------------------

When the novel is roughly finished (that is, it's got an ending, it
will actually never be finished since it might evolve in time) I
intend to publish it in Amazon.com. Since all your contributions will
be here, in the repo, they are obviously acknowledged, but I'll
acknowledge it also in the prologue itself and, if I earn enough to be
able to physically print it and mail it, will mail you a copy. That's
quite unlikely to happen, however, so I'll make a promise I can keep:
to follow you in Twitter.
