He becomes a\r\nraiway hobo, accompanied with a hobo cyborg - the hoborg of the title.\r\n\r\nHow you can help\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nAfter 4 paragraphs, you might have already realized English is not my\r\nmain language. That's not the only way you can help\r\n\r\n* Get a GitHub account http://github.com\r\n* Watch, star or fork this repo. You don't need to do anything else\r\n   for the time being, but it will help me achieve some visibility.\r\n* You can interact with the text and the rest directly from the web:\r\n  you can comment on text and changes in it (called *commits*)\r\n* You can also request changes on the text using *issues*. If you find\r\n  an error of any kind, just raise an issue and I'll fix it (or try\r\n  to).\r\n* Create your own version: once forked, you can use git (check out\r\n  this manual http://wiki.freegeek.org/index.php/Git_for_dummies ) to\r\n  branch and evolve the story in whicheer way you want\r\n* You can keep it (hey, it's free as in free speech) or, if you think\r\n  it's a worthwhile addition to Hoborg, do a Pull Request.\r\n\r\nFull disclosure\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nWhen the novel is roughly finished (that is, it's got an ending, it\r\nwill actually never be finished since it might evolve in time) I\r\nintend to publish it in Amazon.com. Since all your contributions will\r\nbe here, in the repo, they are obviously acknowledged, but I'll\r\nacknowledge it also in the prologue itself and, if I earn enough to be\r\nable to physically print it and mail it, will mail you a copy. That's\r\nquite unlikely to happen, however, so I'll make a promise I can keep:\r\nto follow you in Twitter.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
